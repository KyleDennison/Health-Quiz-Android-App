# Health Quiz Android App

![Demo](Pictures/demoPicture.png)


This repository is a copy of the private original repository, that was moved here for organizational reasons. This is a group project that was worked on with one other student for a Android Mobile Applications course from Feburary to May 2019. The goal of this project was to compete against other class teams to create a health quiz app for the Florida Literacy Coalition. While our team was not the final one choosen to develop the app we still accomplished creating a stylistic and functional Android app using Android Studio and mySQL to manage a database of FLC provided questions/answers.
